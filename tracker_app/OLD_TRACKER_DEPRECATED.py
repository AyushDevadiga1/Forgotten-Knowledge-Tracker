DEPRECATED - Original Surveillance System

This file is kept for reference but should not be used.
The new system uses learning_tracker.py instead.

To use the new system:
  python simple_review_interface.py    # CLI interface
  python web_dashboard.py              # Web interface

The old system tracked:
  ❌ Window titles
  ❌ Screenshots (OCR)
  ❌ Audio classification
  ❌ Eye aspect ratio
  ❌ Keyboard/mouse activity

None of this data was necessary for effective learning.
The new system gets better results with ZERO surveillance.
