# Forgotten Knowledge Tracker - Complete Project Summary

## Project Overview
A Python application designed to track and analyze knowledge consumption patterns to combat the forgetting curve. The system automatically captures screenshots, performs OCR text extraction, and tracks window activity to create a comprehensive record of digital knowledge consumption.

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING
- **Phase 1 & 2 Complete**: Core tracking and capture system fully functional
- **Latest Test Results**: 6 screenshots captured, 2 OCR processes completed, 3 window tracking entries
- **Database**: SQLite storage working correctly

## Key Features Working
1. **Window Tracking**: Monitors active applications and window titles
2. **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots every 30 seconds
3. **OCR Processing**: Extracts text from screenshots using Tesseract
4. **Database Storage**: Saves all data in SQLite database
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout

## Database Schema
- **window_history**: Tracks application usage and window focus
- **screenshots**: Stores screenshot metadata and file paths
- **ocr_results**: Contains extracted text and confidence scores

## Major Issues Resolved
1. **Threading Issues**: Fixed MSS library thread-local object errors
2. **Database Save Problems**: Corrected save_screenshot method to return proper IDs
3. **OCR Integration**: Fixed Tesseract path detection across operating systems
4. **Missing Methods**: Added all required methods in tracker.py

## Dependencies
```
Pillow==10.0.0
mss==9.0.1
psutil==5.9.5
pytesseract==0.3.10
```

## Current Configuration
- **Screenshot Interval**: 30 seconds
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract
- **Database**: SQLite (knowledge_tracker.db)
- **Screenshot Storage**: screenshots/ directory

## Known Working Components
- ✅ Window activity monitoring
- ✅ Screenshot capture with MSS
- ✅ OCR text extraction
- ✅ Database storage and retrieval
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Clean shutdown process

## Next Development Phases

### Phase 3: Enhanced Analysis & Memory Modeling
- Implement Ebbinghaus forgetting curve algorithm
- Add content similarity detection
- Create knowledge retention scoring
- Develop pattern recognition for important vs. casual content

### Phase 4: Smart Reminders System
- Build reminder scheduling based on forgetting patterns
- Add notification system for review
- Create spaced repetition algorithms
- Implement importance weighting

### Phase 5: Web Interface & Analytics
- Build web dashboard for data visualization
- Add productivity pattern analytics
- Create knowledge maps and connections
- Generate usage reports and insights

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python run_tracker.py

# Debug database issues
python debug_database.py
```

## File Locations
- **Main Script**: `run_tracker.py`
- **Database**: `knowledge_tracker.db` (created automatically)
- **Screenshots**: `screenshots/` directory (created automatically)
- **Logs**: Console output with detailed status messages

## Performance Notes
- System runs continuously in background
- Minimal CPU usage (~1-2%)
- Screenshots stored as PNG files
- Database grows approximately 10KB per hour of usage

## Critical Code Fixes Applied
1. **core/database.py**: Fixed save_screenshot to return proper IDs
2. **core/screenshot.py**: Resolved MSS threading issues
3. **core/tracker.py**: Added missing window tracking methods
4. **core/ocr.py**: Enhanced Tesseract path detection

## Ready for Continuation
The system is stable and ready for Phase 3 development. All core functionality works correctly, and the foundation is solid for building advanced features like forgetting curve analysis, smart reminders, and web interfaces.
